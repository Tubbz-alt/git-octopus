git-octopus(1)
==============

NAME
----
git-octopus - extends git-merge with branch naming patterns.

SYNOPSIS
--------
[verse]
'git octopus' [-n|-c] [-s <n>] [-e <pattern>] [<pattern>...]
'git octopus' -v

DESCRIPTION
-----------
<pattern> can be any usual refspec or a naming pattern.
Patterns are resolved using 'git ls-remote', the resulting refs are given to 'git merge'.

In case of conflicts, tries to reuse conflict resolutions stored by 'git conflict' in `refs/conflicts/*`. (See link:git-conflict.html[git-conflict(1)]).

In case of a merge failure, iterates over all the refs, computing merges with each ref (from HEAD) one by one for diagnosic purpose.
Learn more about conflict management on the project's https://github.com/lesfurets/git-octopus[homepage].

OPTIONS
-------
-n::
+
Leaves the repository back to HEAD.

-c::
+
Commit the resulting merge in the current branch. This is the default behavior unless `-n` or `octopus.commit` set to false. Use this option to override the latter.

-s <n>::
+
Chunk mode: the merge is performed by subsets of <n> branches. This is meant to help reading the log graph when lots of branches are merged.

-e <pattern>::
+
Exclude pattern: the merge excludes branches matching the <pattern>.

-v::
+
Prints the version of `git-octopus`

EXAMPLES
--------
* Merge check of the current branch with all feature branches and the master from origin:
+
---------------------------------------------------
$ git octopus -n origin/features/* origin/master
---------------------------------------------------
+
This is basically a merge check you would do before pushing your branch.

CONFIGURATION
-------------
octopus.commit::
+
true by default. set to false behaves like -n

octopus.pattern::
+
Defines a branch naming pattern that 'git octopus' would use by default. Use multiple lines to define several patterns. See link:git-config.html[git-config(1)].

octopus.excludePattern::
+
Defines a branch naming pattern that 'git octopus' will exclude by default.
